The first phase is about the normalization and dimensionality reduction of data. I use a heatmap to show the normalization effect and different methods like PCA, MDS, and tSNE for dimensionality reduction. 
The second phase is about finding the cancer genome for AML and finding various genomes to replace this faulty genome with and cure this cancer.
